      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <section class="history">
        <p>
          This company started as a regular lamp business in 1975. After
          struggling to sell regular lamps for over a decade, my father decided
          to make one last attempt to save the company. He started making and
          selling really strange lamps, and the business has been booming ever
          since!
